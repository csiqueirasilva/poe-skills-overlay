# disclaimer

Currently don't know if using it would violate any terms in the game. Refrain from using it.

# environment

was tested on windows 10

# tested resolutions and environment

added some code to attempt to scale (up or down) everything, based on my display settings (1920x1080).

game has to be on fullscreen windowed for overlay to work.
